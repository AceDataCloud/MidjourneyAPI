# Midjourney Videos API Integration Instructions

This article will introduce the integration instructions for the Midjourney Videos API, which allows you to generate official Midjourney videos by inputting custom parameters.

Next, we will introduce the integration instructions for the Midjourney Videos API.

## Application Process

To use the API, you need to first apply for the corresponding service on the [Midjourney Videos API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/midjourney-videos) page. After entering the page, click the "Acquire" button, as shown in the image below:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/q6ytrc.png)

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the login page inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

During the first application, there will be a free quota available, allowing you to use the API for free.

## Basic Usage

First, understand the basic usage method, which involves inputting the prompt `prompt`, the action `action`, and the array of reference images for the first and last frames `image_url` to obtain the processed result. You first need to simply pass a field `action` with the value `generate`, which mainly includes two actions: generate video (`generate`), extend video (`extend`). The specific content is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/pi72m9.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Here we can see that we have set the Request Headers, including:

- `accept`: the format of the response result you want to receive, here filled in as `application/json`, which means JSON format.
- `authorization`: the key to call the API, which can be directly selected after application.

Additionally, the Request Body is set, including:

- `image_url`: the link to the reference image for the first frame of the generated video.
- `video_id`: the video ID that needs to be specified when extending the video.
- `video_index`: the specific video to be extended specified by `video_id`, with the index starting from 0, defaulting to 0.
- `action`: the action of this video generation task, mainly including two actions: generate video (`generate`), extend video (`extend`).
- `prompt`: the prompt.
- `callback_url`: the URL to receive the callback result.

After selection, you can find that the corresponding code is also generated on the right side, as shown in the image below:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/y0cw0p.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Click the "Try" button to test, as shown in the above image, and we get the following result:

```json
{
  "image_url": "https://storage.fonedis.cc/upload_1751816808164156352.png",
  "image_width": 560,
  "image_height": 688,
  "progress": 100,
  "video_id": "1751816807896311",
  "video_urls": [
    "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/1c67c36c-8177-4f19-ad72-1dc1567265a6/0_0.mp4",
    "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/1c67c36c-8177-4f19-ad72-1dc1567265a6/0_1.mp4",
    "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/1c67c36c-8177-4f19-ad72-1dc1567265a6/0_2.mp4",
    "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/1c67c36c-8177-4f19-ad72-1dc1567265a6/0_3.mp4"
  ],
  "task_id": "037955e0-deee-4050-baa8-1416300d67e2",
  "success": true
}
```

The returned result contains multiple fields, described as follows:

- `success`: the status of the video generation task at this time.
- `task_id`: the ID of the video generation task at this time.
- `image_url`: the cover image of the video generation task at this time.
- `image_width`: the width of the cover image of the video generation task at this time.
- `image_height`: the height of the cover image of the video generation task at this time.
- `video_id`: the video ID of the video generation task at this time.
- `video_urls`: the array of video links of the video generation task at this time.

We can see that we have obtained satisfactory video information, and we only need to obtain the generated Midjourney video based on the video link address in `video_urls`.

Additionally, if you want to generate the corresponding integration code, you can directly copy it, for example, the CURL code is as follows:

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/midjourney/videos' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "action": "generate",
  "prompt": "A cat sitting on a table",
  "image_url": "https://cdn.acedata.cloud/jgo1cw.jpg"
}'
```

## Extend Video Functionality

If you want to continue generating an already created Kling video, you can set the parameter `action` to `extend` and input the ID of the video you want to continue generating. The video ID can be obtained based on the basic usage.

At this point, you can see that the ID of the video from the previous text is:

```
"video_id": "1751816807896311"
```

> Note that the `video_id` here is the ID of the generated video. If you do not know how to generate a video, you can refer to the basic usage above to generate a video.

Next, you must fill in the prompt for the next step to extend the video to customize the generation, which can specify the following content:

- `video_index`: select the index of the video to be extended, which is the index from the `video_urls` generated above, starting from 0, with a default value of 0.
- `video_id`: the specified video ID for extending the video.
- `action`: the action for this video extension, which is `extend`.
- `prompt`: the prompt.

An example of the filled form is as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/855hnj.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

After filling in, the code is automatically generated as follows:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/p58w39.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The corresponding Python code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/midjourney/videos"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "action": "extend",
    "prompt": "A cat sitting on a table",
    "video_id": "1751816807896311",
    "video_index": 1
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

Clicking run, you can find that you will get a result as follows:

```json
{
    "image_url": "https://storage.fonedis.cc/upload_1751817471047011172.png",
    "image_width": 560,
    "image_height": 688,
    "progress": 100,
    "video_id": "1751818094559027",
    "video_urls": [
        "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/a4bd2f43-b925-462d-9725-8aef98403133/0_0.mp4",
        "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/a4bd2f43-b925-462d-9725-8aef98403133/0_1.mp4",
        "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/a4bd2f43-b925-462d-9725-8aef98403133/0_2.mp4",
        "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/a4bd2f43-b925-462d-9725-8aef98403133/0_3.mp4"
    ],
    "task_id": "da3bdcd0-9c21-4b40-877a-2c36e5f479e5",
    "success": true
}
```
It can be seen that the result content is consistent with the above text, which also realizes the extended video function of the video.

## Asynchronous Callback

Since the time taken by the Midjourney Videos API to generate is relatively long, approximately 1-2 minutes, if the API does not respond for a long time, the HTTP request will keep the connection open, leading to additional system resource consumption. Therefore, this API also provides support for asynchronous callbacks.

The overall process is: when the client initiates a request, an additional `callback_url` field is specified. After the client initiates the API request, the API will immediately return a result containing a `task_id` field, representing the current task ID. When the task is completed, the result of the generated video will be sent to the client-specified `callback_url` in the form of a POST JSON, which also includes the `task_id` field, allowing the task result to be associated by ID.

Letâ€™s understand how to operate specifically through an example.

First, the Webhook callback is a service that can receive HTTP requests, and developers should replace it with the URL of their own HTTP server. For demonstration purposes, we use a public Webhook sample site https://webhook.site/, and opening this site will provide a Webhook URL, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/lali6d.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Copy this URL, and it can be used as a Webhook. The sample here is `https://webhook.site/556e6971-b41f-4fa8-9151-6e91acd0399f`.

Next, we can set the `callback_url` field to the above Webhook URL while filling in the corresponding parameters, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/vk0l0a.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Clicking run, we can find that an immediate result is obtained, as follows:

```
{
  "task_id": "b726a27a-f379-4d91-b569-cfe4b7b299ee"
}
```

After a moment, we can observe the generated video result at `https://webhook.site/556e6971-b41f-4fa8-9151-6e91acd0399f`, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/7hcuw8.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

The content is as follows:

```json
{
  "image_url": "https://storage.fonedis.cc/upload_1751818513244368774.png",
  "image_width": 560,
  "image_height": 688,
  "progress": 100,
  "video_id": "1751818512924054",
  "video_urls": [
    "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/9ff3783e-bcf6-4f11-b738-09aa52318e6e/0_0.mp4",
    "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/9ff3783e-bcf6-4f11-b738-09aa52318e6e/0_1.mp4",
    "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/9ff3783e-bcf6-4f11-b738-09aa52318e6e/0_2.mp4",
    "https://storage.fonedis.cc//video/9ff3783e-bcf6-4f11-b738-09aa52318e6e/0_3.mp4"
  ],
  "task_id": "b726a27a-f379-4d91-b569-cfe4b7b299ee",
  "success": true
}
```

It can be seen that the result contains a `task_id` field, and the other fields are similar to the above text, allowing the task to be associated through this field.

## Error Handling

When calling the API, if an error occurs, the API will return the corresponding error code and message. For example:

- `400 token_mismatched`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `400 api_not_implemented`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `401 invalid_token`: Unauthorized, invalid or missing authorization token.
- `429 too_many_requests`: Too many requests, you have exceeded the rate limit.
- `500 api_error`: Internal server error, something went wrong on the server.

### Error Response Example

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "api_error",
    "message": "fetch failed"
  },
  "trace_id": "2cf86e86-22a4-46e1-ac2f-032c0f2a4e89"
}
```
