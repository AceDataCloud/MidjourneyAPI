# Integration and Use of Midjourney Tasks API

The main function of the Midjourney Tasks API is to query the execution status of tasks by inputting the task ID generated by the Midjourney Imagine API or Midjourney Describe API.

This document will provide detailed instructions on integrating the Midjourney Tasks API, helping you easily leverage the powerful features of this API. With the Midjourney Tasks API, you can easily query the execution status of tasks from the Midjourney Imagine API or Midjourney Describe API.

## Application Process

To use the Midjourney Tasks API, you first need to apply for the corresponding service on the application page [Midjourney Imagine API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/e52c028d-897a-4d51-b110-60fccbe6118d), and then copy the task ID from the Imagine API, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/lx4mwb.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Finally, go to the Tasks API page [Midjourney Tasks API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/58ea7cc1-c685-40c3-a619-f29f9ac5d8f4) to apply for the corresponding service. After entering the page, click the "Acquire" button, as shown in the image:

![Application Page](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/rci31i.png)

If you have not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the [login page](https://platform.acedata.cloud) inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

There is a free quota available for first-time applicants, allowing you to use the API for free.

## Request Example

The Midjourney Tasks API can be used to query the results of both the Midjourney Imagine API and the Midjourney Describe API. For information on how to use the Midjourney Imagine API, please refer to the documentation [Midjourney Imagine API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/b0e32002-2707-41cc-b103-a15b1f1efdc1). For information on how to use the Midjourney Describe API, please refer to [Midjourney Describe API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/d2a04242-507c-4a49-a17a-01bc382c5756).

We will take a task ID returned by the Midjourney Imagine API as an example to demonstrate how to use this API. Suppose we have a task ID: 7489df4c-ef03-4de0-b598-e9a590793434, and we will demonstrate how to pass in a task ID.

- `authorization`: The key to call the API, which can be selected directly after application.

**Request Body** includes:

- `id`: The uploaded task ID.
- `action`: The operation method for the task.

Set as shown in the image below:

### Code Example

You can see that various language codes have been automatically generated on the right side of the page, as shown in the image:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/46ookb.png" width="500" class="m-auto"></p>

Some code examples are as follows:

#### CURL

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/midjourney/tasks' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "id": "7489df4c-ef03-4de0-b598-e9a590793434",
  "action": "retrieve"
}'
```

#### Python

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/midjourney/tasks"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "id": "7489df4c-ef03-4de0-b598-e9a590793434",
    "action": "retrieve"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

### Response Example

Upon a successful request, the API will return the details of the image task here. For example:

```json
{
  "_id": "668aae3f550a4144a540803b",
  "id": "7489df4c-ef03-4de0-b598-e9a590793434",

  "created_at": 1720364607.967,
  "credential_id": "68253cc8-505d-47f4-97ad-0050a62e4975",
  "request": {
    "mode": "fast",
    "prompt": "A cat sitting on a table",
    "action": "generate"
  },
  "type": "imagine",
  "hold": false,
  "image_id": "1259525319472185344",
  "job_id": "da3**###**6-f500-48e6-bf32-dd48b3e6f84f",
  "response": {
    "image_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/midjourney/7489df4c-ef03-4de0-b598-e9a590793434.png?imageMogr2/thumbnail/!50p",
    "image_width": 1024,
    "image_height": 1024,
    "actions": [
      "upscale1",
      "upscale2",
      "upscale3",
      "upscale4",
      "reroll",
      "variation1",
      "variation2",
      "variation3",
      "variation4"
    ],
    "raw_image_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/midjourney/7489df4c-ef03-4de0-b598-e9a590793434.png",
    "raw_image_width": 2048,
    "raw_image_height": 2048,
    "progress": 100,

  },
  "duration": 29.437000036239624,
  "finished_at": 1720364637.404
}
```

The returned result contains multiple fields, with the request field being the request body when the task was initiated, and the response field being the response body returned after the task is completed. If type = imagine, its result is consistent with the request and return of the Midjourney Imagine API; if type = describe, its result is consistent with the request and return of the Midjourney Describe API. The field descriptions are as follows.

- `id`: The ID of the image generation task, used to uniquely identify this image generation task.
- `type`: If type = imagine, it represents the result of the Midjourney Imagine API; if type = describe, it represents the result of the Midjourney Describe API.
- `job_id`: The ID of the image query task generated, used to uniquely identify this image query task.
- `image_id`: The unique identifier of the image task being queried, which needs to be passed when performing transformation operations on the image next time.
- `request`: The request information in the image task query.
- `response`: The return information in the image task query.

## Batch Query Operation

This is for querying the details of multiple task IDs, and unlike the above, the action needs to be selected as retrieve_batch.

**Request Body** includes:

- `ids`: An array of uploaded task IDs.
- `action`: The operation method for the task.

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

## Error Handling

When calling the API, if an error occurs, the API will return the corresponding error code and message. For example:

- `400 token_mismatched`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `400 api_not_implemented`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `401 invalid_token`: Unauthorized, invalid or missing authorization token.
- `429 too_many_requests`: Too many requests, you have exceeded the rate limit.
- `500 api_error`: Internal server error, something went wrong on the server.

### Error Response Example

```
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "api_error",
    "message": "fetch failed"
  },
  "trace_id": "2cf86e86-22a4-46e1-ac2f-032c0f2a4e89"
}
```
