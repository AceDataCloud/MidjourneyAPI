# Midjourney Imagine API Application and Usage

Midjourney is a very powerful AI drawing tool that can generate exquisite images in just one or two minutes by simply inputting keywords. Midjourney stands out in the industry with its outstanding drawing capabilities, and today, it has been widely applied across various industries and fields, with its influence becoming increasingly significant.

This document mainly introduces the usage process of the Imagine operation in the Midjourney API, allowing us to easily generate the required images through text.

## Application Process

To use the Midjourney Imagine API, you can first go to the [Midjourney Imagine API](https://platform.acedata.cloud/documents/e52c028d-897a-4d51-b110-60fccbe6118d "Midjourney Imagine API") page and click the "Acquire" button to obtain the credentials needed for the request:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/nyq0xz.png)

If you are not logged in or registered, you will be automatically redirected to the login page inviting you to register and log in. After logging in or registering, you will be automatically returned to the current page.

There will be a free quota granted upon the first application, allowing you to use the API for free.

## Basic Usage

Next, you can fill in the corresponding content on the interface, as shown in the figure:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/d01h9f.png)

When using this interface for the first time, we need to fill in at least two pieces of content: one is `authorization`, which can be selected directly from the dropdown list. The other parameter is `prompt`, which is the description of the image we want to generate. It is recommended to describe it in English for more accurate and better results. Here we used the example content `Lamborghini speeds inside a volcano`, which represents the desire to draw a Lamborghini speeding inside a volcano.

You can also notice that there is corresponding code generation on the right side; you can copy the code to run it directly or click the "Try" button for testing.

After the call, we find that the returned result is as follows:

```json
{
  "image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1233387694839697411/1234197197067915365/36rgqit64j90qptsxnyq_Lamborghini_speeds_inside_a_volcano_id0494_f47263b6-ff92-44a3-88ee-51cf0e706aae.png?ex=662fdb36&is=662e89b6&hm=ca9be54907726937ed02517a13466bef2afb2825b7cda4b313de56a3c3310d0d&width=1024&height=1024",

  "raw_image_height": 2048,
  "progress": 100,
  "actions": [
    "upscale1",
    "upscale2",
    "upscale3",
    "upscale4",
    "reroll",

    "variation4"
  ],
  "task_id": "1bae3bec-3ac4-4180-a148-74ee6cb68b98",
  "success": true
}
```

The returned result contains multiple fields, described as follows:

- `task_id`, the ID of the task that generated this image, used to uniquely identify this image generation task.
- `image_id`, the unique identifier of the image, which needs to be passed when performing transformation operations on the image next time.
- `image_url`, the URL of the thumbnail, which can be opened directly to view the generated effect.
- `image_width`: the pixel width of the thumbnail.
- `image_height`: the pixel height of the thumbnail.
- `raw_image_url`: the URL of the original image, which is the same as the thumbnail content but in higher definition, loading a bit slower.
- `raw_image_width`: the pixel width of the original image.
- `raw_image_height`: the pixel height of the original image.
- `actions`, a list of further operations that can be performed on the generated image. Here, a total of 8 are listed, where `upscale` represents enlargement, and `variation` represents transformation. So `upscale1` represents the enlargement operation on the first image in the top left corner, and `variation3` represents the transformation operation based on the third image in the bottom left corner.

By opening the link corresponding to `image_url` or `raw_image_url`, you can find the result as shown in the figure.

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/qr2iyj.png)

It can be seen that a 2x2 preview image has been generated here. So far, the first API call has been completed.

## Image Upscaling and Transformation

Next, we will try to perform further operations on the currently generated photo. For example, if we think the second image in the top right corner is quite good, but we want to make some transformation adjustments, we can further fill in the `action` as `variation2` and pass the `image_id`:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/ia7vpw.png)

At this point, the result obtained is as follows:

```json
{
  "image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1233387694839697411/1234201336543969401/36rgqit64j90qptsxnyq_Lamborghini_speeds_inside_a_volcano_id0494_10dc56a7-ec16-4bac-878e-2338f2ae5f5d.png?ex=662fdf10&is=662e8d90&hm=9aec96bca35ae20b6f9ab536101b9c4ea255eb6216cbf7000ac554937da071f3&width=1024&height=1024",

  ],
  "task_id": "f4961620-1104-409f-9dc1-ba3ed15c2f4d",
  "success": true
}
```
Open `image_url`, the newly generated image is as follows:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/4g6r09.png)

As we can see, for the image in the upper right corner from the previous one, we have again obtained four similar photos.

At this point, we can select one of them for a refined zoom operation. For example, if we choose the fourth one, we can pass `action` as `upscale4`, and then pass the current image's ID again through `image_id`.

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/jk9ohl.png)

> Note: The `upscale` operation takes less time compared to `variation` in Midjourney.

The return result is as follows:

```json
{
  "image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1233387694839697411/1234202545208033400/36rgqit64j90qptsxnyq_Lamborghini_speeds_inside_a_volcano_id0494_34edc3f5-2bd0-4f5b-a372-03270b02289b.png?ex=662fe031&is=662e8eb1&hm=f8006c4d33a03dfd027dffe4eb46ab0d113a4910aef07497f0b335c8998b7858&width=512&height=512",
  "image_width": 512,
  "image_height": 512,
  "image_id": "1234202545208033400",
  "raw_image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1233387694839697411/1234202545208033400/36rgqit64j90qptsxnyq_Lamborghini_speeds_inside_a_volcano_id0494_34edc3f5-2bd0-4f5b-a372-03270b02289b.png?ex=662fe031&is=662e8eb1&hm=f8006c4d33a03dfd027dffe4eb46ab0d113a4910aef07497f0b335c8998b7858&",
  "raw_image_width": 1024,
  "raw_image_height": 1024,
  "progress": 100,
  "actions": [
    "upscale_2x",
    "upscale_4x",
    "variation_subtle",
    "variation_strong",
    "zoom_out_2x",
    "zoom_out_1_5x",
    "pan_left",
    "pan_right",
    "pan_up",
    "pan_down"
  ],
  "task_id": "03f62b17-a6f1-4c8e-9b4d-1fc7bd5b1180",
  "success": true
}
```

Among them, `image_url` is shown as follows:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/jfndfo.png)

Thus, we have successfully obtained a photo of a Lamborghini.

At the same time, note that the `actions` contain several operations that can be performed, described as follows:

- `upscale_2x`: Enlarges the image by 2 times, resulting in a 2x high-definition image.
- `upscale_4x`: Enlarges the image by 4 times, resulting in a 4x high-definition image.
- `zoom_out_2x`: Reduces the image by 2 times (filling surrounding areas).
- `zoom_out_1_5x`: Reduces the image by 1.5 times (filling surrounding areas).
- `pan_left`: Shifts the image to the left.
- `pan_right`: Shifts the image to the right.
- `pan_up`: Shifts the image upwards.
- `pan_down`: Shifts the image downwards.

You can continue to pass the corresponding transformation commands for continuous image generation operations.

## Image Rewrite (Base Image)

This API also supports image rewriting, commonly known as base image. We can input an image URL and the description text that needs to be rewritten, and the API will return the rewritten image.

> Note: The input image URL must be a pure image, not an image displayed on a webpage; otherwise, image rewriting cannot be performed. It is recommended to use an image hosting service to upload and obtain the image URL.

For example, we have an image of a sunset on a highway, with some trees and buildings beside the road, as shown:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/mq335u.png)

Now we want to rewrite it to be next to a beach, with a car parked by the roadside. We can construct the following prompt:

```bash
https://cdn.acedata.cloud/v014oc.png an illustration of a car parked on the beach --iw 2
```

As we can see, the beginning of our prompt is an HTTPS image link, followed by a space, and then the prompt text content. Here we also used some additional advanced parameters, such as `—iw 2` to adjust the image weight.

We can pass the above content as a whole to the `prompt` field, as shown:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/pfcoy1.png)

The output result is as follows:

```bash
{
  "image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1234427310434947145/1234539663515975690/atmateosa5693_An_illustration_of_a_car_parked_on_the_beach_id26_cc8650ec-7e4b-4685-8911-78172430d8a7.png?ex=66311a28&is=662fc8a8&hm=c39707a1f22bc7f12874060ea6ed58ba37c188139ccc9a13c61ed9f37e66ea74&width=1456&height=816",
  "image_width": 1456,
  "image_height": 816,
  "image_id": "1234539663515975690",
  "raw_image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1234427310434947145/1234539663515975690/atmateosa5693_An_illustration_of_a_car_parked_on_the_beach_id26_cc8650ec-7e4b-4685-8911-78172430d8a7.png?ex=66311a28&is=662fc8a8&hm=c39707a1f22bc7f12874060ea6ed58ba37c188139ccc9a13c61ed9f37e66ea74&",
  "raw_image_width": 2912,
  "raw_image_height": 1632,
  "progress": 100,
  "actions": [
    "upscale1",
    "upscale2",
    "upscale3",
    "upscale4",
    "reroll",
    "variation1",
    "variation2",
    "variation3",
    "variation4"
  ],
  "task_id": "24a79e8b-a79d-471a-aef7-089dc0627ee8",
  "success": true
}
```

At this point, we have obtained the following generated image:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/1vwkuv.png)

As we can see, while maintaining the overall style and composition of the original image, the entire scene has changed to be next to a beach, and a car has appeared on the road. This is Prompt with Image.

## Image Fusion

This API also supports image fusion, allowing us to input multiple images to achieve different image fusion effects.

For example, here we have two images, one of a teddy bear and the other of a chainsaw, as shown:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/8fapzl.png" width="300" class="m-auto"></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/c1igbw.png" width="300" class="m-auto"></p>
Now we want to merge the two, allowing this bear to hold the chainsaw. How do we do it?

We can construct the following prompt:

```bash
https://cdn.acedata.cloud/8fapzl.png https://cdn.acedata.cloud/c1igbw.png The bear is holding the chainsaw --iw 2
```

It can be seen that similar to Image with Prompt, we place multiple image URLs at the beginning of the prompt, separated by spaces, and finally add the text prompt, passing the above content as a whole to the `prompt` parameter. The running effect is as follows:

```bash
{
  "image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1234291876639674388/1234547236830973972/kcisok_The_bear_is_holding_the_chainsaw_id8873344_ad605bc4-ba19-4807-b94f-367dab672f7a.png?ex=66312136&is=662fcfb6&hm=0fb1e2261c9a30b04de9da9b23b7562eb73677f1bbda1fae52c7243b12d25aac&width=1024&height=1024",
  "image_width": 1024,
  "image_height": 1024,
  "image_id": "1234547236830973972",
  "raw_image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1234291876639674388/1234547236830973972/kcisok_The_bear_is_holding_the_chainsaw_id8873344_ad605bc4-ba19-4807-b94f-367dab672f7a.png?ex=66312136&is=662fcfb6&hm=0fb1e2261c9a30b04de9da9b23b7562eb73677f1bbda1fae52c7243b12d25aac&",
  "raw_image_width": 2048,
  "raw_image_height": 2048,
  "progress": 100,
  "actions": [
    "upscale1",
    "upscale2",
    "upscale3",
    "upscale4",
    "reroll",
    "variation1",
    "variation2",
    "variation3",
    "variation4"
  ],
  "task_id": "891f2645-ee15-4c7b-ac24-d98163c8e57e",
  "success": true
}
```

We have obtained the following result:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/vjtzdo.png)

It can be seen that we have successfully achieved image fusion.

> Note: The image fusion can support up to 5 image URLs as input, which means it can support the fusion of up to 5 images, with the input format as above.

## Local Transformation

This API also supports local drawing functionality for images, but it only supports generating images based on the content above. We can pass in a unique ID of the generated image, the action parameter for local redrawing, and the mask for the area to be redrawn, to achieve redrawing in the masked area.

For example, here we have a generated image of a cat:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/t1tdf9.png" width="300" class="m-auto"></p>

Now we want to redraw the cat's face. How do we do it?

First, we need to obtain the mask for that area. This mask is obtained by Base64 encoding a grayscale image. Below are some tools to obtain the mask:

Example code to obtain the mask in Python:

```python
import sys
import os
from PySide6.QtWidgets import *
from PySide6.QtGui import QPainter, QMouseEvent, QPen, QColor, QImage
from PySide6.QtCore import Qt, QPoint

class DrawingWidget(QWidget):
    def __init__(self, imagePath):
        super().__init__()
        self.setAttribute(Qt.WA_StaticContents)
        self.background_image = QImage(imagePath)
        imageSize = self.background_image.size()*0.8
        self.setFixedSize(imageSize)
        self.foreground_image = QImage(self.size(), QImage.Format_ARGB32)
        self.foreground_image.fill(Qt.transparent)
        self.drawing = False
        self.lastPoint = QPoint()
        self.pen_color = QColor(255, 255, 255, 255)
        self.pen_size = 50

    def set_pen_size(self, size):
        self.pen_size = size

    def mousePressEvent(self, event: QMouseEvent):
        if event.button() == Qt.LeftButton:
            self.drawing = True
            self.lastPoint = event.pos()

    def mouseMoveEvent(self, event: QMouseEvent):
        if event.buttons() & Qt.LeftButton and self.drawing:
            painter = QPainter(self.foreground_image)
            painter.setRenderHint(QPainter.Antialiasing, True)
            pen = QPen(self.pen_color, self.pen_size,
                       Qt.SolidLine, Qt.RoundCap, Qt.RoundJoin)
            painter.setPen(pen)
            painter.drawLine(self.lastPoint, event.pos())
            self.lastPoint = event.pos()
            self.update()

    def mouseReleaseEvent(self, event: QMouseEvent):
        if event.button() == Qt.LeftButton and self.drawing:
            self.drawing = False

    def paintEvent(self, event):
        canvasPainter = QPainter(self)
        canvasPainter.drawImage(
            self.rect(), self.background_image, self.background_image.rect())
        canvasPainter.drawImage(
            self.rect(), self.foreground_image, self.foreground_image.rect())

    def save_image(self, path):
        self.foreground_image.save(path)

class MainWindow(QDialog):
    def __init__(self, imagePath):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowTitle("mask tool")
        self.drawing_widget = DrawingWidget(imagePath)
        self.currentPath = os.getcwd().replace("\\", "/")
        self.tempPath = self.currentPath + "/temp.jpg"
        self.projectPath = ""
        self.setDone = False

    def init_ui(self):
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(self.drawing_widget)
        controls_layout = QHBoxLayout()
        size_label = QLabel("pen size:")
        controls_layout.addWidget(size_label)
        self.size_slider = QSlider(Qt.Horizontal)
        self.size_slider.setMinimum(100)
        self.size_slider.setMaximum(400)
        self.size_slider.setValue(400)
        self.size_slider.valueChanged.connect(self.update_pen_size)
        controls_layout.addWidget(self.size_slider)
        self.lineEdit_addPromp = QLineEdit()
        layout.addWidget(self.lineEdit_addPromp)
        save_button = QPushButton("   Start partial redrawing   ")
        save_button.clicked.connect(self.save_image)
        controls_layout.addWidget(save_button)
        dont_button = QPushButton("   Cancel partial redraw   ")
        dont_button.clicked.connect(self.dont_image)
        controls_layout.addWidget(dont_button)
        layout.addLayout(controls_layout)
        self.setLayout(layout)

    def update_pen_size(self):
        size = self.size_slider.value()
        self.drawing_widget.set_pen_size(size)

    def save_image(self):
        tempImage = self.currentPath + "/temp.jpg"
        self.drawing_widget.save_image(self.tempPath)
        self.prompt = self.lineEdit_addPromp.text()
        self.setDone = True
        self.close()

    def dont_image(self):
        self.setDone = False
        self.close()

    def closeEvent(self, event):
        if self.setDone:
            pass
        else:
            self.setDone = False
        event.accept()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    imagePath = "test.png"
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    mainWindow = MainWindow(imagePath)
    mainWindow.init_ui()
    mainWindow.exec()
```

By using the above code, we can obtain the mask image. During this process, we need to ensure that the mask image is the same size as the original image, and the white area in the mask image is the area to be redrawn. Below is a comparison of the mask image needed for the cat image and the original image:

Original image:
<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/t1tdf9.png" width="300" class="m-auto"></p>

Mask image:
<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/bjnrra.png" width="300" class="m-auto"></p>

Finally, we also need to convert the mask image to Base64 encoding. Below is the code to convert to Base64:
```python
import cv2
import base64

image_path = 'temp.jpg'
gray_image = cv2.imread(image_path)
_, buffer = cv2.imencode('.jpg', gray_image)
base64_encoded = base64.b64encode(buffer).decode('utf-8')
with open('grayscale_image_base64.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(base64_encoded)

print("success!")
```

> Note: The above Python code describes the process of generating a mask. If you want to integrate it into your product, please write the corresponding code in the appropriate language based on its principles.

Through the above code, we obtained the mask `mask` that needs to be redrawn. Next, we also need to set the parameter `action` to `variation_region`, generate the image ID `image_id` (refer to the content above for obtaining this parameter), and pass in the corresponding mask `mask`. The other parameter information is as follows:

- `action`: The behavior of the operation on the image, here it is `variation_region`, indicating a local redraw of the image.
- `prompt`: Descriptive words for the local redraw of the image (optional parameter).
- `image_id`: The unique identifier of the image, facilitating local redrawing of the image.
- `mask`: The base64 encoding of the mask area corresponding to the image (the image is specified by the above image_id).

Therefore, according to the above rules, we need to set the correct parameters. The parameter `prompt` is a non-mandatory parameter. Here, for the sake of comparison, the `prompt` for the mask area is set to `A cute cat`. The specific parameter settings are shown in the figure below:

### Response Example

After a successful request, the API will return the image result information after face swapping. For example:

```json
{
  "image_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/midjourney/6c9450d8-1c22-4f85-a527-e7a7bfb4a61b.png?imageMogr2/thumbnail/!50p",
  "image_width": 1024,
  "image_height": 1024,
  "actions": [
    "upscale1",
    "upscale2",
    "upscale3",
    "upscale4",
    "reroll",
    "variation1",
    "variation2",
    "variation3",
    "variation4"
  ],
  "raw_image_url": "https://platform.cdn.acedata.cloud/midjourney/6c9450d8-1c22-4f85-a527-e7a7bfb4a61b.png",
  "raw_image_width": 2048,
  "raw_image_height": 2048,
  "progress": 100,
  "image_id": "1265876571323891712",
  "task_id": "6c9450d8-1c22-4f85-a527-e7a7bfb4a61b",
  "success": true
}
```

It can be seen that the image of the mask area has undergone a redraw operation, and the returned result is consistent with the content above, as shown in the figure below:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/8vslhq.png)

We can see that we have successfully achieved a local redraw of the custom area of the generated image.

## Asynchronous Callback

Since generating images with Midjourney requires some waiting time, this API is also designed for a long-waiting mode by default. However, in some scenarios, long waiting may incur additional resource overhead, so this API also provides an asynchronous Webhook callback method. When the image generation is successful or fails, the result will be sent to the specified Webhook callback URL via an HTTP request. After the callback URL receives the result, it can perform further processing.

The following demonstrates the specific calling process.

First, the Webhook callback is a service that can receive HTTP requests, and developers should replace it with the URL of their own HTTP server. For demonstration purposes, a public Webhook sample site [https://webhook.site/](https://webhook.site/ "https://webhook.site/") is used here. By opening this site, you can obtain a Webhook URL, as shown in the figure:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/srf3tq.png)

Copy this URL, and it can be used as a Webhook. The sample here is [https://webhook.site/995d0a91-d737-40a7-a3b9-5baf68ed924c](https://webhook.site/995d0a91-d737-40a7-a3b9-5baf68ed924c "https://webhook.site/995d0a91-d737-40a7-a3b9-5baf68ed924c").

Next, we can set the field `callback_url` to the above Webhook URL and fill in the `prompt`, as shown in the figure:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/hclosy.png)

After clicking test, you will immediately receive a response with a `task_id`, which is used to identify the current generation task's ID, as shown in the figure:

<p><img src="https://cdn.acedata.cloud/vkr32a.png" width="300" class="m-auto"></p>

After a moment, when the image generation is complete, you can find that the Webhook URL has received an HTTP request, as shown in the figure:

![](https://cdn.acedata.cloud/6znvgq.png)

The result is the outcome of the current task, as follows:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "task_id": "f6e39eaf-652a-4bf5-a15c-79d8b143b80a",
  "image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1234291876639674388/1234551030549839932/kcisok_A_cat_sitting_on_a_table_id2724480_591c5c85-ec80-42ab-9fe5-9adfbed192e4.png?ex=663124be&is=662fd33e&hm=da725eb74aae375d60beec38b4cd26c5a7b373b1662f222ff838a8ea6fd5e798&width=1024&height=1024",
  "image_width": 1024,
  "image_height": 1024,
  "image_id": "1234551030549839932",
  "raw_image_url": "https://midjourney.cdn.acedata.cloud/attachments/1234291876639674388/1234551030549839932/kcisok_A_cat_sitting_on_a_table_id2724480_591c5c85-ec80-42ab-9fe5-9adfbed192e4.png?ex=663124be&is=662fd33e&hm=da725eb74aae375d60beec38b4cd26c5a7b373b1662f222ff838a8ea6fd5e798&",
  "raw_image_width": 2048,
  "raw_image_height": 2048,
  "progress": 100,
  "actions": [
    "upscale1",
    "upscale2",
    "upscale3",
    "upscale4",
    "reroll",
    "variation1",
    "variation2",
    "variation3",
    "variation4"
  ]
}
```

The `success` field indicates whether the task was executed successfully. If successful, there will also be the same `actions`, `image_id`, and `image_url` fields, which are the same as the return results mentioned above. Additionally, there is a `task_id` to identify the task, allowing for the association of the Webhook result with the initial API request.

If the image generation fails, the Webhook URL will receive content similar to the following:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "task_id": "7ba0feaf-d20b-4c22-a35a-31ec30fc7715",
  "error": {
    "code": "bad_request",
    "message": "Unrecognized argument(s): `-c`, `x`"
  }
}
```

Here, the `success` field will be `false`, and there will also be `error.code` and `error.message` fields describing the details of the task error. The Webhook server can process the results accordingly.

## Streaming Output

Midjourney officially has progress when generating images. Initially, it is a blurry photo, and after several iterations, the image gradually becomes clear, ultimately resulting in a complete image.

Therefore, the image generation process can be roughly divided into the stages of "sending command" -> "starting image generation (multiple iterations gradually becoming clear)" -> "image generation complete."

When streaming output is not enabled, this API goes through the entire process from "sending command" to "image generation complete" when making a request, and the image generation process is included in it. Since Midjourney itself generates images relatively slowly, the entire process may take about a minute or longer.

To provide a better user experience, this API supports streaming output, meaning that when "starting image generation," it begins to return results. Whenever there is a change in drawing progress, the results will be streamed until the image generation is complete.

If you want to return responses in a streaming manner, you can change the `accept` parameter in the request header to `application/x-ndjson`, but the calling code needs to be modified accordingly to support streaming responses.

Python sample code:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.acedata.cloud/midjourney/imagine'
headers = {
    'content-type': 'application/json',
    'accept': 'application/x-ndjson',
    'authorization': 'Bearer {token}'
}
body = {
    "prompt": "a beautiful cat --v 6"
}
r = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=body, stream=True)
for line in r.iter_lines():
    print(line.decode())
```

Running result:

You can see that after enabling streaming output, the returned result is a line-by-line JSON.

In a Node.js environment, the implementation code can be written as follows:

```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

const url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/midjourney/imagine";
const headers = {
  "content-type": "application/json",
  accept: "application/x-ndjson",
  authorization: "Bearer {token}",
};
const body = {
  prompt: "a beautiful cat --v 6",
  action: "generate",
};

axios
  .post(url, body, { headers: headers, responseType: "stream" })
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.status);
    response.data.on("data", (chunk) => {
      console.log(chunk.toString());
    });
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

The results of these examples are all similar.

Please note that in the streaming output result, there is a field called progress, which indicates the generation progress, ranging from 0 to 100. If needed, you can display this information on the page.

> Note: When the generation is not fully completed, the `actions` field is empty, indicating that further processing operations cannot be performed on the intermediate image. After the generation is completed, the image_url generated during the process will be destroyed.

Additionally, you can combine the streaming results with asynchronous callbacks by specifying the request header `accept=application/x-ndjson` and the request body of callback_url, then the callback_url can receive multiple POST requests of streaming results.
