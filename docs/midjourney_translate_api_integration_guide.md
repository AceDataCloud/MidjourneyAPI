There is a free quota available for first-time applicants, allowing you to use the API for free.

## Request Example

Let's take a Chinese descriptive term as an example to demonstrate how to use the API. Suppose the Chinese descriptive term is: exquisite, flawless, pure white angel. Next, we will demonstrate how to upload the Chinese descriptive term and obtain the English descriptive term.

### Setting Request Headers and Request Body

**Request Headers** include:

- `accept`: Specifies that the response result should be in JSON format, set to `application/json`.
- `authorization`: The key to call the API, which can be selected directly after application.

**Request Body** includes:

- `content`: The uploaded Chinese descriptive term.

Set as shown in the image below:

Some code examples are as follows:

#### CURL

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.acedata.cloud/midjourney/translate' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer {token}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "content": "精致，无暇，洁白的天使"
}'
```

#### Python

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.acedata.cloud/midjourney/translate"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "authorization": "Bearer {token}",
    "content-type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "content": "精致，无暇，洁白的天使"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.text)
```

### Response Example

After a successful request, the API will return one descriptive piece of information translated from the Chinese descriptive term. For example:

```json
{
  "content": "Exquisite, flawless, pure white angel"
}
```

As you can see, the result contains a `content` field, which includes the translated English descriptive term, corresponding to the translation of the Chinese descriptive term.

- `content`, generates the corresponding English descriptive term, which can be used for image generation tasks.

## Error Handling

When calling the API, if an error occurs, the API will return the corresponding error code and message. For example:

- `400 token_mismatched`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `400 api_not_implemented`: Bad request, possibly due to missing or invalid parameters.
- `401 invalid_token`: Unauthorized, invalid or missing authorization token.
- `429 too_many_requests`: Too many requests, you have exceeded the rate limit.
- `500 api_error`: Internal server error, something went wrong on the server.

### Error Response Example

```
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "api_error",
    "message": "fetch failed"
  },
  "trace_id": "2cf86e86-22a4-46e1-ac2f-032c0f2a4e89"
}
```
